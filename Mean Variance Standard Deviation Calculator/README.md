# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

**Completed**: 7/23/25
**Part Of** FreeCodeCamp's Data Analysis with Python Certification.

This project uses NumPy and Python to create a function to computer the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of a 3x3 matrix constructed from a list of 9 values.

## Project Description (From FreeCodeCamp):

"Create a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

The input of the function should be a list containing 9 digits. The function should convert the list into a 3 x 3 Numpy array, and then return a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix."

## Guidelines:

- **Input**: A list containing 9 digits
- **Output**: A Dictionary containing the resulting calculations
- **Error Handeling**: If the list is empty, or doesn't contain 9 elements in it, raise a ValueError.

## Technologies used:
- NumPy
- Python
- VSCode / Gitpod (Starter Boilerplate)

## How to Run:
- Install Python & NumPy
- Run the script by typing python (or python3) main.py
